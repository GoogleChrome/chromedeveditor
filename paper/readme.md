# Paper

A distribution of the Polymer Core and Paper elements.

This Dart package contains the JavaScript Polymer components without a Dart wrapper.
They can be used as is. The components have been vulcanized, so they are safe to use
in a CSP environment (such as Chrome Apps).

See http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/ for more infomation.
