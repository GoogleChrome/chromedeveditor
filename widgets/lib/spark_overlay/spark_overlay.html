/**
 * See g-overlay https://github.com/Polymer/toolkit-ui/tree/master/elements.
 *
 * spark-overlay displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts out
 * hidden and is displayed by setting it's opened property
 * to true. A spark-overlay's opened state can be toggled by calling the toggle
 * method.
 *
 * It's common to want a spark-overlay to animate to and from its opened position.
 * The 'animation' attribute provides some basic open/close animations. For example,
 * assigning animation="fade" to a spark-overlay will make it fade into
 * and out of view as it opens and closes. Note, if multiple spark-overlay's are
 * opened, they should stack on top of each other.
 *
 * Styling: The size and position of a spark-overlay should be setup via css.
 * spark-overlay is natually sized around its content. When a spark-overlay is opened
 * it is shown and the 'opened' class is added to it. This is typically where
 * css transitions and animations are applied. When the spark-overlay is closed,
 * the 'opened' class is removed and a 'closing' class is added. Use 'closing'
 * to customize the closing animation.
 *
 * Supported values for the 'animation' attribute:
 *
 * * fade: fade in/out when opened/closed
 * * scale-slideup: open - fade in and shrink; close - grow and slide up
 * * shake: open - fly in and shake; close - shake and fly out.
 *
 * It's common to use spark-overlay to gather user input, for example a login
 * dialog. To facilitate this, spark-overlay supports automatic focusing of a
 * specific element when it's opened. The element to be focused should be given
 * an `focused` attribute.
 *
 * An element that should close the spark-overlay will automatically do so if it
 * is given the overlay-toggle attribute. Please note that spark-overlay will
 * close whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. The
 * behavior can be turned on and off via the autoClose property.
 *
 *     <spark-overlay class="spark-overlay-scale-slideup">
 *       <h2>Dialog</h2>
 *       <input placeholder="say something..." focused>
 *       <div>I agree with this wholeheartedly.</div>
 *       <button overlay-toggle>OK</button>
 *     </spark-overlay>
